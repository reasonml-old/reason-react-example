Prerequisite: having [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) installed (version 1.7+), e.g. `brew install ninja` if you're on macOS.

```
git clone https://github.com/chenglou/rehydrate-example.git
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open up the html files in `src/*`! Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
