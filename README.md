```sh
git clone https://github.com/chenglou/reason-react-example.git
cd reason-react-example
npm install
npm run build
```

Then open `src/index.html` to see the links to the examples (**no server needed!**). 

To keep a watcher open, do:

```sh
npm start
```

In another tab, also do
```sh
npm run webpack
```

This builds and watches the files. You can then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
